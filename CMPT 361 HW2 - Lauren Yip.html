<h4>Honor statement:</h4>
<p>I have not cheated in any way when doing this assignment, I did it on my own. I may have asked questions about the assignment on Coursys, I know that’s totally fine and even encouraged. I also already know that this class is graded on a curve. I realize that if I cheat and by some miracle not get caught, any increase in my grade will in turn shift the curve and result in lower grades for my classmates. Any undeserved extra grade would come at the cost of all others. That’s horrible! I would never do it.</p>

<h4>1: Take four photograph pairs or sets of 4.</h4>

<h4>2: FAST feature detector</h4>

<h4>2: FASTR feature detector</h4>

<p>It was very hard to tell which points were discarded, so I also made Matlab plot both sets of points on top of each other so I could easily identify. </p>
<p>On S2-im1, there were some points on the curve of a chair in the background that got cut in the FASTR, as well as a few points on the wrist and shirt outline</p>
<p>On S1-im1, there were a few points on the light part of the hill near the center of the image, as well as a cluster in the bottom middle</p>
<p>FAST Keypoint Detection (avg): 0.0798 sec  -    FASTR Keypoint Detection (avg): 0.0060 sec</p>
<p>There was a significant difference between my FAST and FASTR Keypoint detection average times (calculated the average of all 8 pictures) This difference is because with the Harris Cornerness Metric, many points are discarded earlier on - saving computation time.</p>
<h4>3: Point description and matching</h4>

<p>We know that there will be many more FAST points than FASTR points, so more matches in this case as well. However, I was a bit surprised at how many more matches I got on S1 than S2. Accounting for number of FAST/FASTR points (there were a bit more than double in S1 compared to S2), there were still more matches by more than 10x. My data is here: 
  </p><p>S1-im1.png: 2196 FAST keypoints detected
    S1-im2.png: 1944 FAST keypoints detected
    Number of matches: 618
    S1-im1.png: 1795 FASTR keypoints detected
    S1-im2.png: 1556 FASTR keypoints detected
    Number of matches: 497</p>  <p>S2-im1.png: 838 FAST keypoints detected
        S2-im2.png: 914 FAST keypoints detected
        Number of matches: 42
        S2-im1.png: 694 FASTR keypoints detected
        S2-im2.png: 722 FASTR keypoints detected
        Number of matches: 35</p>
    <p>In S2, we see many more matches in FAST compared to FASTR, in one certain section in the arm/lower area of the images</p>
    <p>S1 does not have as obvious of discrepancies between FAST and FASTR, probably because there are so many more matches that they overlap visually.</p>

<h4>4: RANSAC and Panoramas</h4>

<p>=== Optimal RANSAC Parameters ===
    FAST: MaxNumTrials = 1000, MaxDistance = 3
    FASTR: MaxNumTrials = 1000, MaxDistance = 5</p>

<h4>5: Large Panoramas</h4>

    <h4>Honor statement:</h4>
    <p>
      I have not cheated in any way when doing this assignment, I did it on my
      own. I may have asked questions about the assignment on Coursys, I know
      that’s totally fine and even encouraged. I also already know that this
      class is graded on a curve. I realize that if I cheat and by some miracle
      not get caught, any increase in my grade will in turn shift the curve and
      result in lower grades for my classmates. Any undeserved extra grade would
      come at the cost of all others. That’s horrible! I would never do it.

    <h4>1: Take four photograph pairs or sets of 4.</h4>

    <h4>2: FAST feature detector</h4>

    <h4>2: FASTR feature detector</h4>
    <img src="S1-fastR.png" alt="S1-fastR" width="300" />
    <img src="S2-fastR.png" alt="S2-fastR" width="300" />

    <p>
      There were significant differences between FAST and FASTR - notably,
      overall density. As for specific points, in soft areas like the clouds in
      S1 we saw way fewer points in FASTR compared to FAST. And in S2, the round
      areas like the box and poster features had way fewer points in FASTR than
      FAST.
    </p>
    <p>
      My average time for FAST was 1.7868 seconds and for FASTR it was
      0.5119 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a significant difference that makes sense due the nature of the
      functions, FASTR being more selective and quickly discarding bad points.

    <h4>3: Point description and matching</h4>

    <br /><br />
    <img src="S2-fastRMatch.png" alt="S2-fastRMatch" width="600" />

    <p>
      There was one noticeable outlier/wrong point in S1 FASTR. Other than that,
      FAST and FASTR performed comparably, though as expected there are fewer
      FASTR than FAST matches.

    <h4>4: RANSAC and Panoramas</h4>

    <img src="S3-panorama.png" alt="S3-panorama" width="600" />
    <br /><br />
    <img src="S4-panorama.png" alt="S4-panorama" width="600" />

    <p>
      === Optimal RANSAC Parameters === FAST: MaxNumTrials = 100, MaxDistance =
      5 FASTR: MaxNumTrials = 50, MaxDistance = 5
    </p>

    <p>
      I used half the number of trials on FASTR since the points are less noisy
      already and don't require as many trials. I kept the same distance
      allowing for a small amount of flexibility in matching. I also let FAST
      have a lower confidence threshold because there are more points overall ->
      fewer false positives, and FASTR has a higher confidence threshold since
      any point is filtered already and should be good.
